The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
Example 2:


Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
0 <= Node.val <= 104

Code 

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

 We 1st go for leftmost leaf node and check wether the house is going to rob or not,
 it is dicided by generating an array of size 2 in which 1st value indicate rob amount
 and 2nd value indicate not rob amount. Formula use for rob is 
 Rob = [ node.val + left[1]+ right[1]]; Not Rob = max[left[0], left[1]] + max[right[0], right[1]]. and the result is Max (Rob, Not Rob)....

    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
     int[] answer = helper(root);
